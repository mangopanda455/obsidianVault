 Why do cells need to divide? What processes might require cell division to occur?

-   For repair
    
-   Replacement of dead cells
    
-   To grow
    
-   To reproduce (asexual, unicellular, bacteria)
  

T in mitosis = twin (identical cells)

Helps differentiate from meiosis 

  

## Result of Mitosis

-   2 genetically identical daughter cells

Mitosis

-   Make two exact copies of one cell each called a daughter cell
    
-   Part of the cell cycle
    
-   Cell is mostly in interphase for its whole life cycle
    
-   G1 for growth
    
-   S for DNA synthesis
    
-   G2 for more growing
    
-   G0 never divides
    
-   Mitosis is for dividing the nuclei
    
-   Then you get two exact copies of the same cell
    
-   Not quick
    
-   Nuclear envelope fragments releasing chromosomes
    
-   Centrosomes are made of microtubules, and the center is centrioles which organize the microtubules
    
-   First thing is the centrosome replicates then form microtubules
    
-   Packs very tightly
# Prophase

Dna copied

Centrosome replicate

# Prometaphase

Chromosomes condense

Mitotic spindle forms

Nuclear envelope fragments

Microtubules attach to the kinetochore 

# Metaphase

Chromosomes line up along the Metaphase plate

“Middle phase”

# Anaphase

Anaphase, chromatids move APART

# Telophase

Cell elongation

Cleavage furrow

Daughter nuclei form

# Cytokinesis

nuclear envelope

  
  
  

-   Cyclins act like an accelerator pedal on the cell cycle, speeding up cell division
    
-   Tumor suppressors act like brakes, slowing down the cell cycle & cell division
