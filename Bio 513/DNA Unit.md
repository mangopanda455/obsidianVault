-   Griffith: Discovered the genetic role of DNA

-   2 strains of a bacterium, pathogenic “s” strain and harmless “r” strain
    
-   When heat killed s mixed with living r, some living cells become pathogenic
    
-   R strain took up a substance of the S strain, changing the Phenotype to the S type (substance changed the genotype of the R strain)



-   Avery Macleod and McCarthy
    
-   Determined that the transforming factor is DNA
    
-   They degraded protein, RNA and DNA and found that the mouse lived when the DNA was degraded ( no DNA = no pathogenic bacteria)
    
-   Now called transformation: assimilation (taking in) of foreign DNA
    
-   “Transformation” = DNA magically changed the R strain to the S strain
  
  

-   Hershey
    
-   Viruses: Good to study because they are only made of protein and DNA
    
-   Experiment:



-   Used radioactive isotope of phosphorus to tag the DNA of bacteriophages in one culture
    
-   Used radioactive isotope of sulfur to tag the protein of bacteriophages in a second culture



-   Results: showed that only DNA (not protein) from the virus entered bacteria. DNA is the genetic material in a chromosome

<u>Do now:</u> What is the monomer of DNA? What is it comprised (made) of?
- Nucleotide Monomers
- Sugar, Phosphate group, nitrogenous base
- Sugar and phosphate are the backbone of DNA ladder
- nitrogenous bases are the rungs of the ladder

<h1>DNA Structure and Replication</h1>

- The nucleotide is made up of 3 parts
- Phosphate, Nitrogen-containing base, and deoxyribose sugar
- 3 Nitrogen containing bases, Adenine (A), Thymine (T), Guanine (G), and Cytosine (C)
- Ladder model and Helix model
- Adenine can only be paired with Thymine with 2 hydrogen bonds
- Guanine can only pair with Cytosine with 3 hydrogen bonds
- Double helix is like the ladder model, but just spiraling


<h2>Semi-Conservative Replication</h2>
- Enzyme DNA Helicase (ends in -ase so it is usually an enzyme) breaks the hydrogen bonds between the nucleotides
- Essentially "unzips" the double helix DNA strand
- The strands of DNA separate
- The free nucleotides are attracted to the exposed bases on the loose strands of DNA because of the complementary base-pair rule
- Then the hydrogen bonds are re-formed between the loose nucleotides and the loose strands
- This is called the Semi-Conservative Replication because half of the original strand of DNA is kept in the newly replicated strand
- This type of replication prevents mutations because it is using the original unmutated DNA strand as a guide or template so it is less likely for there to be mistakes
- In general the count of the bases is evenly spread, although it depends on the organism
- Chromatin is the loose DNA in the nucleus
- DNA is replicated in synthesis
- DNA condensed in mitosis
- Centromere is the center of a chromosome that connects the sister chromatids


<h2>Checkpoint 16.1</h2>
1. How did bacterial transformation occur in Griffith's famous experiment?
	1. R cells were not deadly and S were. R injected into mice live, S injected kills. heat killed S cells and living R cells injected the mouse died, found living S cells in the mouse. R cells absorbed the DNA of the S cells, turning them into living S cells.
2. In Hershey and Chase's experiment with the bacterial T2 virus (bacteriophage), what result would you expect if protein were the genetic material?
	1. Wanted to figure out whether DNA or protein is the genetic material. They would have found radioactive sulfur in the cell instead of radioactive phosphorus.
3. A fly has the following percentages of nucleotides in its DNA: 27.3% A, 27.6% T, 22.5% G, and 22.5% C. How do these numbers demonstrate Chargaff's rules?
	1. Almost the same amount of A and T as C and G. Probably there is a mutation to account for the missing Adenine.
4. How did Watson and Crick's model explain the basis for Chargaff's rules?
	1. There must be and attraction between the bases to form a double helix shape.



Concept 16.2: Many proteins work together in DNA replication and repair

- Replication is the making of DNA from and existing DNA strand.
	- Occurs during the S phase of interphase when chromosomes replicates
- DNA replication is semi-conservative:
	- At the end of replication, each of the daughter strands consists of one old (parent) and one new strand


Replication is not conservative or dispersive. Semiconservative is the best and only method used to replicate DNA. Both daughter strands will be half of the parent strand. 

Took a bacteria and grew it in an environment of nitrogen 15, one extra neutron.
Took some of the nitrogen 15 bacteria and put it into a nitrogen 14 environment.
Took one sample after 20 minutes and one after 40 minutes, after 20 there is one replication and after 40 there is two.

1st rep:

2 different strands, half 15 and half 14, 15s being the old strand and 14s being the newer strand.

2nd rep:

4 different strands, 2 strands have a 15 and 14 side, then the two middle ones have only 14 strands

|            | 1st rep | 2nd rep |
| ---------- | ------- | ------- |
| 1st strand | N15, N14  | N15, N14  |
| 2nd strand | N15, N14  | N14, N14  |
| 3rd strand | N/A     | N14, N14  |
| 4th strand | N/A     | N15, N14  |

4. A space probe returns with a culture of a microorganism found on a planet. Analysis shows that it is a carbon-based life form that has DNA. You grow the cells in N15 medium for several generations and the transfer to N14 medium. 

You will have a layer with N14 DNA and one hybrid layer and another N15 layer


1. The replication of DNA begins at sites call the origin of replication.
2. Helicase separate the two DNA stands, forming a replication bubble.
3. An RNA primer binds to the start sequence.
4. Enzymes called DNA polymerases catalyze elongation of new DNA at the replication fork (Y-shaped region)

U                       A                         A                    C                    G                    G                T

RNA primer = U A A
When the RNA primer is seen, the enzyme knows where to start replicating



5. DNA polymerase III adds nucleotides to the growing chain, one by one, working in the 5' to 3' direction (each gets added to the 3' side) matching adenine with thymine, and guanine with cytosine, etc.
6. Recall that strands are antiparallel.
	1. Leading strand: 5' to 3'; DNA replication occurs continuously
	2. Lagging strand: 3' to 5'; this stand is copied in a series of segments called Okazaki fragments



DNA polymerase only works in the 5' to 3' section, so pieces are added backwards from top to bottom. Okazaki fragments then need to be glued together by DNA ligase.

Lagging strand:
1. Made in the 3' to 5' direction
2. RNA primer gets added
3. DNA polymerase III adds nucleotides to form an Okazaki fragment, until it reaches the next RNA primer
	1. DNA polymerase III synthesizes the second fragment
4. DNA polymerase I replaces the RNA primer with DNA nucleotides
5. Ligase forms bonds between the fragments
	1. Each NUCLEOTIDE gets added in the 5' to 3' direction, but
	2. Each Okazaki FRAGMENT is added in the 3' to 5' direction (DNA synthesized in one direction)
